The following repository analyzes the MLB's new runner on second rule for extra innings. It contains a script that automates the data cleaning process for play-by-play charts corresponding to games spanning the past decade. The files Markov_Chain.py and LogitModel.py take the cleaned dataframes and convert them into Markov matrices (generating expected number of runs at any state of an inning) and a logistic classifier (predicting whether an inning ends in a tie or not), respectively.
